Upgrading
=========

StatusNet 1.1.x to GNU social 1.2.x
-----------------------------------

We cannot support migrating from any other version of StatusNet than 
1.1.1. If you are running a StatusNet version lower than this, please 
follow the upgrade procedures for each respective StatusNet version.

You are now running StatusNet 1.1.1 and want to migrate to GNU social
1.2.x. Beware there may be changes in minimum required version of PHP
and the modules required, so review the INSTALL file (php5-intl is a
newly added dependency for example).

* Before you begin: Make backups. Always make backups. Of your entire 
directory structure and the database too. All tables. All data. Alles.

To do a backup of the database, you can use a variant of this command
(you will be interactively prompted for the db user's password):
    $ mysqldump -u dbuser -p dbname > social-backup.sql

0. Stop your queue daemons 'bash scripts/stopdaemons.sh' should do it.
    Not everyone runs queue daemons, but the above command won't hurt.

1. Unpack your GNU social code to a fresh directory. You can do this
    by cloning our git repository:
    $ git clone https://gitorious.org/social/mainline.git gnusocial

2. Synchronize your local files to the GNU social directory. These 
    will be the local files such as avatars, config and files:

        avatar/*
        background/*
        file/*
        local/*
        .htaccess
        config.php

    This command will point you in the right direction on how to do it:
    $ rsync -avP statusnet/{.htaccess,avatar,background,file,local,config.php} gnusocial/

3. Replace your old StatusNet directory with the new GNU social
    directory in your webserver root.

4. Run the upgrade script: 'php scripts/upgrade.php'
   The upgrade script will likely take a long time because it will
    upgrade the tables to another character encoding and make other
    automated upgrades. Make sure it ends without errors. If you get
    errors, create a new task on https://bugz.foocorp.net/

5. Start your queue daemons: 'bash scripts/startdaemons.sh'

6. Report any issues at https://bugz.foocorp.net/ (tag GNU social)
