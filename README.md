This is the README file for GNU social, the free
software social networking platform. It includes
general information about the software and the
project.

Some other files to review:

- INSTALL: instructions on how to install the software.
- UPGRADE: upgrading from earlier versions
- CONFIGURE: configuration options in gruesome detail.
- PLUGINS.txt: how to install and configure plugins.
- EVENTS.txt: events supported by the plugin system
- COPYING: full text of the software license

Information on using GNU social can be found in
the "doc" subdirectory or in the "help" section
on-line, or you can catch us on IRC in #social on
the freenode network.

## About

GNU social is a free social networking
platform. It helps people in a community, company
or group to exchange short status updates, do
polls, announce events, or other social activities
(and you can add more!). Users can choose which
people to "follow" and receive only their friends'
or colleagues' status messages. It provides a
similar service to sites like Twitter, Google+ or
Facebook, but is much more awesome.

With a little work, status messages can be sent to
mobile phones, instant messenger programs (using
XMPP), and specially-designed desktop clients that
support the Twitter API.

GNU social supports an open standard called
OStatus <http://ostatus.org/> that lets users in
different networks follow each other. It enables a
distributed social network spread all across the
Web.

GNU social was originally developed for the
service, Identi.ca <http://identi.ca/>.

It is shared with you in hope that you too make an
service available to your users. To learn more,
please see the Open Software Service Definition
1.1:

Additional library software has been made available in the 'extlib'

for additional terms.

## New this version

This is a security fix and bug fix release since 1.1.0,
released 2 July 2012. All 1.1.0 sites should upgrade to this version.

It includes the following changes:

- Fixes for SQL injection errors in profile lists.
- Improved ActivityStreams JSON representation of activities and objects.
- Upgrade to the Twitter 1.1 API.
- More robust handling of errors in distribution.
- Fix error in OStatus subscription for remote groups.
- Fix error in XMPP distribution.

### Troubleshooting

The primary output for GNU social is syslog,
unless you configured a separate logfile. This is
probably the first place to look if you're getting
weird behaviour from GNU social.

If you're tracking the unstable version of
GNU social in the git repository (see below), and you
get a compilation error ("unexpected T_STRING") in
the browser, check to see that you don't have any
conflicts in your code.

### Unstable version

If you're adventurous or impatient, you may want
to install the development version of
StatusNet. To get it, use the git version control
tool <http://git-scm.com/> like so:

    git clone git@gitorious.org:social/mainline.git

Using it is a mixed bag. On the positive side, it
usually includes the latest security and bug fix
patches. On the downside, it may also include
changes that require admin intervention (like
running a script or even raw SQL!) that may not be
documented yet. It may be a good idea to test this
version before installing it on your production
machines.

To keep it up-to-date, use 'git pull'. Watch for
conflicts!
