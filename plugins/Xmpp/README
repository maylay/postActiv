The XMPP plugin allows users to send and receive notices over the
XMPP/Jabber/GTalk network.

Installation
============
add "addPlugin('xmpp',
    array('setting'=>'value', 'setting2'=>'value2', ...);"
to the bottom of your config.php

The daemon included with this plugin must be running. It will be
started by the plugin along with their other daemons when you run
scripts/startdaemons.sh. See the section "Queues and daemons" in
INSTALL for more about queuing and daemons.


Settings
========
user*: user part of the jid
server*: server part of the jid
resource (gnusocial): resource part of the jid
port (5222): port on which to connect to the server
encryption (true): use encryption on the connection
host (same as server): host to connect to. Usually, you won't set this.
debug (false): log extra debug info (e.g. sent/recv XMPP stanzas)
public: list of jid's that should get the public feed (firehose)

* required
default values are in (parenthesis)

Note that setting 'host' is required if the XMPP service is configured
with DNS SRV records, since XMPPHP does currently not support SRV
lookups.


Example
=======
addPlugin('xmpp', array(
    'user'=>'update',
    'resource'=>'social',
    'server'=>'identi.ca',
    'password'=>'...',
    'public'=>array('bob@aol.com', 'sue@google.com')
));
