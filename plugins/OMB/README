OMB (OpenMicroBlogging) plugin
==============================

This plugin encapsulates OpenMicroBlogging 0.1 functionality. OMB was the
original federation protocol for StatusNet, but has been deprecated
in favor of OStatus (see the OStatus plugin). This plugin is provided for
backward-compatibility with older sites, and for posterity.

External libraries
------------------

This is provided with the plugin, but you may wish to use a newer version of
the library, if and when it becomes available.

Installation

Offline Processing
------------------

Note: once you have a sizable number of users, sending OMB messages whenever
someone posts a message can really slow down your site; it may cause posting
to timeout. You may wish to enable queuing and handle OMB communication
offline. See the "queues and daemons" section of the main StatusNet README.
