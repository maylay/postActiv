%%site.name%% supports the [OpenID](http://openid.net/) standard for single signon between Web sites. OpenID lets you log into many different Web sites without using a different password for each. (See [Wikipedia's OpenID article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID) for more information.)

If you already have an account on %%site.name%%, you can [login](%%action.login%%) with your username and password as usual.
To use OpenID in the future, you can [add an OpenID to your account](%%action.openidsettings%%) after you have logged in normally.

There are many [Public OpenID providers](http://openid.net/get-an-openid/), and you may already have an OpenID-enabled account on another service.
